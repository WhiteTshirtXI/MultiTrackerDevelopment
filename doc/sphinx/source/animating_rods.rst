Animating the rods
===================

To animate the rods, you need to use the wmBarbershop guide curve deformer.

#. 	Select:

	* the wmFigRodNode, and
	* the wmFurSetNode.

	.. note: You can also run the guide curve deformer by selecting a set of curves and the furset.
	
#. 	Run the script ``wmBarberShop -gcd``.  

The rods and hair will now animate in sync.

Needs
------

The latest need is wmFigaro-0032_M2010_64


Concepts
---------

Rods - Figaro uses rods to solve the dynamics for the hair. To create the dynamics, you need to create rods.  

Collisions - Collisions happen in two parts. The first part is applies a (configurable) force to try and stop things colliding. The second part 

Edge/edge vs point-triangle. 


xx types of collisions:
Normal collisions
Volumetric collisions

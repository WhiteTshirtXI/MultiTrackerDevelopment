Attaching collision objects
===========================

If other objects are going to collide with the hiar, you need to attach them as collision objects.  



#.	Select:

	*	the polygon mesh(es) for the object(s) to collide with the hair, and
	*	the wmFigaro node for the hair.

#.	From the Figaro menu, select **Add selected meshes as collision objects**. 


	Figaro creates a wmFigCollisionNode. This lets you control the :ref:`attributes of the collision object<attributes_collision_node>`.
